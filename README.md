# ReLexRNN :Text Regeneration Using Lexicon-Based Sentimatal Analysis via Recurrent Neural Networks 


### Algorithm for the lexicon-based sentimental analysis
The algorithm consists of two key components, namely sentiment normalisation and evidence-based combination function, which have been used in order to estimate the intensity of the sentiment rather than positive/negative label and to support the mixed sentiment classification process
